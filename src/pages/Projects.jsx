                        <p>I developed an AI-driven car simulation using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. In this project, I implemented a neural network that controls multiple cars as they navigate through a simulated road.</p>
                        <p>The cars learn to drive autonomously by avoiding collisions with other vehicles. The project features a mutation process where the AI's performance is continuously improved based on its ability to avoid traffic.</p>
                        <p>I utilized local storage to save and retrieve the best-performing neural network, allowing the simulation to evolve over time. This project demonstrates my skills in AI, neural networks, and dynamic visualizations.</p>

                        <p>I created a classic Snake game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game features smooth controls and responsive gameplay, where players guide a snake to eat food, causing it to grow longer. The game increases in difficulty as the snake speeds up with each food item consumed.</p>
                        <p>I implemented collision detection to end the game when the snake runs into itself, and a high score system that keeps track of the player's best performance. The game's interface is clean and minimalist, with visual and audio feedback for a more engaging experience.</p>
